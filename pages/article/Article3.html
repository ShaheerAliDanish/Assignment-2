    <h2 id="sf">STAR FISH</h2>
    <p>Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating marine creatures that grace the world's oceans with their unique appearance and behavior. These captivating animals are not </p>
    <p>actually fish but belong to a group of echinoderms. What sets them apart is their distinctive radial symmetry, with typically five arms extending from a central body, resembling a </p>
    <p>celestial star. Starfish come in a variety of vibrant colors and are well-adapted to their underwater habitats, where they use tiny tube feet on their undersides to move and navigate. </p>
    <p>They are voracious predators, often preying on mollusks and other small sea creatures by using their tube feet to pry open shells. Beyond their ecological role, starfish hold a special </p>
    <p>place in marine folklore and scientific study, representing both the beauty and mystery of the oceans they inhabit.</p>

    <h2 id="wh">WHALE</h2>
    <p>Whales, the gentle giants of the oceans, are among the most remarkable and majestic creatures on Earth. These massive marine mammals, ranging from the colossal blue whale </p>
    <p>to the charismatic humpback and the intelligent orca, capture our imagination with their sheer size and grace as they glide through the depths. Whales are known for their complex </p>
    <p>social structures, impressive communication skills, and astounding migrations that span thousands of miles. Their haunting songs and playful breaches at the water's surface leave </p>
    <p>an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to witness them in their natural habitat. Whales hold a vital ecological role, contributing to the balance of marine ecosystems and </p>
    <p>serving as indicators of ocean health. However, they also face numerous threats, including habitat degradation, pollution, and whaling, making conservation efforts crucial to ensure </p>
    <p>the survival of these magnificent creatures for future generations.</p>

    <h2 id="jf">JELLY FISH</h2>
    <p>Jellyfish, with their ethereal and otherworldly appearance, are intriguing yet enigmatic creatures of the ocean. These gelatinous animals, found in oceans all around the world, </p>
    <p>come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Drifting through the water with rhythmic pulsations, they are more than 95% water themselves, making them incredibly delicate and </p>
    <p>fragile. Despite their seemingly simple structure, jellyfish have an ancient lineage dating back hundreds of millions of years, making them one of the oldest living creatures on Earth. </p>
    <p>While their mesmerizing beauty has captivated many, some species can deliver painful stings with their tentacles, making them a subject of both fascination and caution for those </p>
    <p>who venture into the seas. Jellyfish serve a crucial role in marine ecosystems, balancing the populations of other marine species and contributing to the intricate web of life in the </p>
    <p>world's oceans. Their mysterious existence continues to inspire marine biologists and artists alike, reminding us of the vast wonders that lie beneath the surface of the seas.</p>

    <h2 id="su">SEA URCHINS</h2>
    <p>Sea urchins, intriguing and prickly marine creatures, play vital roles in ocean ecosystems. These spiny, globe-shaped animals are echinoderms, closely related to sea stars and sea </p>
    <p>cucumbers. Despite their outwardly intimidating appearance, sea urchins are fascinating creatures with a variety of adaptations. They use their tube feet and spines for locomotion </p>
    <p>and protection. Sea urchins are primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and kelp, and their grazing habits can significantly influence the structure of underwater habitats. They are </p>
    <p>known for their intricate jaw apparatus called "Aristotle's lantern," which they use to scrape and ingest food. Additionally, sea urchins have economic importance in some regions, as </p>
    <p>their roe, known as "uni," is considered a delicacy in sushi cuisine. These enigmatic creatures serve as essential components of marine ecosystems, and their study contributes to our </p>
    <p>understanding of the complex interactions within underwater environments.</p>
