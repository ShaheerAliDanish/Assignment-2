    <h2 id="pb">POLAR BEAR</h2>
    <p>The polar bear, scientifically known as Ursus maritimus, is an iconic symbol of the Arctic and is the largest terrestrial carnivore on the planet. These magnificent creatures are superbly </p>
    <p>adapted to their extreme environment, with a thick layer of blubber and dense fur that provide insulation against the frigid temperatures of the Arctic. Polar bears are excellent </p>    
    <p>swimmers, capable of covering long distances in the icy waters in search of their primary prey, seals. They use their keen sense of smell to locate seals beneath the ice and their</p>  
    <p>powerful limbs to break through the ice and capture their prey. Unfortunately, polar bears face a dire threat due to the rapid loss of sea ice caused by climate change, which is </p>
    <p>diminishing their hunting grounds and impacting their ability to find food. Conservation efforts are crucial to the survival of polar bears, as they are not only a symbol of the Arctic </p>
    <p>but also serve as a bellwether for the health of the entire ecosystem in which they live.</p>
